# Next.js Console Shell

This is a minimal Next.js application with a single page styled to look like a console shell.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

The main page is styled to resemble a terminal window, but is not interactive.
